# 🌟 React Tabs  

The **React Tabs** application is centered around a dynamic and modular tabs component, designed to ensure **reusability** and **scalability**. This modular architecture enhances code maintainability, promotes a consistent user experience, and facilitates easier updates in the future.  

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Design Approach  
The application leverages modern frontend technologies and best practices:  

- **React.js** – Leveraged for building a dynamic and component-based UI.  
- **Vite** – Ensures fast development with hot module replacement (HMR).  
- **Redux Toolkit** – Manages global state efficiently.  
- **Redux Saga** – Handles side effects and async actions within Redux.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Provides utility-first styling for consistent and responsive design.  
- **Vitest** – Facilitates unit testing and code coverage analysis.  
- **ESLint** – Ensures code quality through consistent linting.

## ✅ Achievements  
### 🔹 **Modularity and Reusability**  
- Components are fully reusable and adhere to modular design principles.  

### 🔹 **Code Quality**  
- Followed modern coding standards using state-of-the-art development, state management, testing, and styling tools.  

### 🔹 **Routing**  
- Implemented **query parameters** to maintain tab state across browser sessions and URL updates.  

### 🔹 **Styling**  
- Styling closely matches the provided design specifications.  

### 🔹 **Functionality**  
- The Tab Panel and its data are dynamic, sourced from a JSON file (can be replaced with a REST API).  

### 🔹 **Documentation**  
- Leveraged **GitHub Copilot** to generate consistent and comprehensive code documentation.  

### 🔹 **Unit Tests**  
- Added sufficient unit tests to cover core functionality and edge cases.  

### 🔹 **README.md**  
- Leveraged **GitHub Copilot** to beautify the README.md file
